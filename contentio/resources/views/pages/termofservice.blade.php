                                    <br/> <br/>
                        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) constitute a binding contract between you and Contentio (“us” or “we” or “Contentio”) governing the use of and access to the products we offer in connection with a paid or trial subscription (“Products”) to you and any authorized individuals engaged by you to use the Products on your behalf (each, a “User,” and collectively, “Users”). By using or accessing the Products, or authorizing or permitting any User to use or access the Products, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company, organization, or other legal entity (“Entity”), you agree to these Terms for that Entity and represent to Contentio that you have the authority to bind such Entity and its affiliates to these Terms. In such cases, “you” or “Customer” shall refer to such Entity and its affiliates. If you are a Customer’s User, then these Terms will apply to you to the extent they are applicable to Users. If Customer is an agency, then a User may also be an agency client as described in Section 10 (Agencies). If you do not have the authority to bind the Entity to these Terms or do not agree to these Terms, do not accept these Terms or use or access the Products.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        You represent and warrant that the information you provide in registering for the Products is accurate, complete, and rightfully yours to use.

                        While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep our Website available and accessible, the Website may be unavailable from time to time for repairs, upgrades, routine and emergency maintenance, or other interruptions that may be out of our reasonable control, including any outages of Third-Party Services (as defined in Section 5) or any related application programming interface (“APIs”) and integrations. Interruptions of our Website shall not serve as a basis to terminate your subscription or demand any full or partial refunds or credits of prepaid and unused subscription fees.

                        OUR USE OF THIRD PARTY INTEGRATIONS AND SERVICES

                        Our Website may contain links to or allow you to connect and use certain external third-party products, services, or software in conjunction with your use of our Website and Products (“Third Party Services,” and each, a “Third Party Service”), including certain social media networks and other integration partners. To take advantage of these features, you may be required to sign up or log into such Third Party Service on their respective websites. By enabling the Website to access such Third Party Service, you are permitting Contentio to pass on your login information to the Third Party Service and granting the Third Party Service permission to access or otherwise process your data. You acknowledge that your use of such Third Party Service is governed solely by the terms and conditions, acceptable use policy, privacy policy or any other similar policy or terms of such Third Party Service (including, but not limited to, the Twitter Terms of Service located at www.twitter.com/tos and the YouTube Terms of Service located at https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) (collectively, “Third Party Service Terms”), and that Contentio does not endorse, is not liable for, and makes no representations as to the Third Party Service, its content, or the manner in which such Third Party Service uses, stores, or processes your data. We are not liable for any damage or loss arising from or in connection with your enablement of such Third Party Service and your reliance on the policies, privacy practices, and data security processes of such Third Party Service. We are not responsible or liable for any changes to or deletion of your data by the Third Party Service. Certain features of our Products may depend on the availability of these Third Party Services and the features and functionality they make available to us. We do not control Third Party Service features and functionality, and they may change without any notice to us. If any Third Party Service stops providing access to some or all of the features or functionality currently or historically available to us, or stops providing access to such features and functionality on reasonable terms, as determined by Contentio in our sole discretion, we may stop providing access to certain features and functionality of our Products. We will not be liable to you for any refunds or any damage or loss arising from or in connection with any such change made by the Third Party Service or any resulting change to our Products. You irrevocably waive any claim against Contentio with respect to such Third Party Services.

                        CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Termination by You. You may terminate your account at any time without cause, but you will not be entitled to any refunds of any prepaid and unused fees, and any unpaid fees under your Plan for the applicable subscription term will become immediately due and payable. You may terminate your account and receive a prorated refund of any prepaid and unused fees, if we fail to cure a material breach of these Terms within thirty (30) days of our receipt of written notice from you describing the breach. You may also cancel your account as provided in Section 6 (Payment).
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Termination by Us. We may restrict functionality of the Products or temporarily suspend your account if we reasonably believe that you have violated these Terms. Unless we believe the need to restrict or suspend access is time-sensitive and requires immediate action without notice, or we are prohibited from providing notice under law or legal order, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you by email prior to such suspension. We will not be liable to you or any third parties for any of the foregoing actions. We may terminate your account and use of the Products for any of the following reasons: (i) you fail to comply with these Terms, (ii) you do not pay your fees in accordance with the payment terms under your Plan, (iii) at the expiration of the subscription period of your Plan if we provide prior written notice to you, (iv) you become the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (v) if we reasonably determine you are acting or have acted in a way that could present substantial reputational harm to Contentio or our current or prospective partners or customers. In no event will any termination by us for the foregoing reasons entitle you to any refunds of any prepaid and unused fees or relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees payable to us prior to the date of termination, and any unpaid fees under your Plan will become immediately due and payable. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, hateful, discriminatory or illegal activity may be grounds for immediate termination of your use of the Product and may be referred to law enforcement authorities.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Post Termination. If your account is terminated, you must cease using the Products and Contentio reserves the right to delete your account settings and Content within thirty (30) days of such cancellation or termination with no liability or notice to you. Once your account settings and Content are deleted, you will not be able to recover such account settings and Content, except any Content that remains on Third Party Services pursuant to the terms and conditions of such Third-Party Services.

Each party agrees to restrict access to the Confidential Information of the other party to those employees, advisors, agents and other representatives who require access in order to perform its obligations under these Terms.

                        OUR INDEMNIFICATION OF YOU
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        We agree to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any and all claims, losses, demands, liabilities, damages, settlements, expenses, and costs (including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs) brought by a third party against you alleging your use of any Product infringes or misappropriate any patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, or intellectual property right of any third party. We will not have any obligation under this section for any infringement or misappropriation if it arises out of or is based upon: (a) any use of the Products that is in combination with other products or services if such infringement or misappropriation would not have arisen but for such combination, (b) use of the Products by you for purposes not intended, permitted, or outside of the scope of the rights granted to you under these Terms, or (c) any modification of the Products not made or authorized in writing by Contentio (the “Excluded Claims''). If you are enjoined or otherwise prohibited from using a Product or a portion thereof based on an allegation that the Product violates any third party intellectual property right, or if we reasonably determine that such prohibition is likely, then we will, at our sole expense and option: (a) obtain for you the right to use the allegedly infringing portions of the Products; (b) modify the allegedly infringing portions of the Products so as to render them non-infringing without substantially diminishing or impairing their functionality, or (c) replace the allegedly infringing portions of the Products with non-infringing items of substantially similar functionality. If we determine that the foregoing remedies are not commercially reasonable, then we may terminate the impacted subscription, or portion thereof, and will promptly provide a prorated refund or credit to you for any prepaid and unused fees.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        This Section 15 states Contentio’s sole and exclusive liability, and your sole and exclusive remedy, for the actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property Rights by the Products.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        YOUR INDEMNIFICATION OF US
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Your failure to comply with any of your obligations set forth in these Terms shall be considered a breach of these Terms. You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Contentio and its Affiliates, and each of its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns from any and all third party claims, losses, demands, liabilities, damages, settlements, expenses, and costs (including attorney’s fees and costs), arising from, in connection with, or based on allegations of, your or your Users’ breach of these Terms, use of Third-Party Services, or for any action arising from the Excluded Claims.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Requirements for Indemnification. Either party’s indemnification obligations shall be contingent on: (a) the indemnified party (“Indemnitee”) providing the indemnifying party (“Indemnitor”) prompt written notice of the claim, (b) Indemnitee granting Indemnitor full and complete control over the defense and settlement of the claim, and (c) Indemnitee providing assistance in connection with the defense and settlement of the claim as Indemnitor shall reasonably request.

                        LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Exclusion of Consequential and Related Damages. NEITHER PARTY NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY, UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, ENHANCED, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, BUSINESS, OR DATA; BUSINESS INTERRUPTION; OR LOSS OF GOODWILL OR REPUTATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PARTY IS APPRISED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES OCCURRING OR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES WERE OTHERWISE FORESEEABLE.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Monetary Cap on Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF CONTENTIO AND OUR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO CONTENTIO UNDER THE APPLICABLE PLAN DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL NOT IN ANY WAY LIMIT YOUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 6 ABOVE. THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVIDED FOR HEREIN WILL APPLY IN AGGREGATE TO YOU AND YOUR AFFILIATES.

                        Independent Allocations of Risk. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE PRICING OFFERED BY CONTENTIO TO YOU AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        State Prohibition of Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Implied Warranties. Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. IN THESE STATES, EACH PARTY’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
                                    <br/> <br/>

                        Assignability. Neither party may assign its right, duties, and obligations under these Terms without the other party’s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that Contentio may assign these Terms, and the rights granted to Contentio under these Terms, without your consent to a successor (including a successor by way of merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or operation of law) if the successor agrees to assume and fulfill all of Contentio’s obligations under these Terms.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Notices. Except as otherwise specified in these terms, any notices under these Terms must be sent to Contentio by email to info@contentio.pro. Any notices under these Terms that are sent to you shall be sent via email to the current named account owner of your Contentio account.

                        Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for, or be considered to be in breach of or default under these Terms on account of, any delay or failure to perform as required by these Terms (except for your obligations to make payments to Contentio hereunder) as a result of any cause or condition beyond its reasonable control, so long as that party uses commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove the causes of non-performance.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Governing Law. These Terms will be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the laws of Germany, without reference to its choice of law rules.  
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Venue. In circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes (Section 18.10) permits the parties to litigate in court, these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, excluding its conflict of law rules. Under such limited circumstances, each party hereby expressly and irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal, state, and local courts in Cook County, Illinois in connection with such an action.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes. You and Contentio agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, except to the extent either party has breached or threatened to breach its confidentiality obligations or either party has in any manner violated or threatened to violate the other party’s Intellectual Property Rights. Under such limited circumstances, Contentio may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Products, or intellectual property infringement without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described herein. In all other cases, both parties hereby agree to submit to arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rule with one (1) arbitrator to be selected by mutual agreement of the parties. If we cannot agree on the arbitrator selection, then the American Arbitration Association shall choose an arbitrator for us from the National Panel of Arbitrators. You agree that an arbitrator cannot award punitive damages to either party and to abide by and perform any award rendered by the arbitrator. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, which shall include, but not be limited to, the courts within Cook County, Illinois.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Waiver and Severability. The waiver by Contentio of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall not be deemed a further or continuing waiver of any other provision of these Terms, and any failure of Contentio to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal for any reason, such provision shall be limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and effect.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Entire Agreement. Except for any service order, these Terms are the final and complete expression of the agreement between these parties regarding your use of the Products and Application. These Terms supersede, and the terms of these Terms govern, all previous oral and written communications regarding these matters. Contentio will not be bound by, and specifically objects to, any term, condition, or other provision that is different from or in addition to these Terms (whether or not it would materially alter this agreement) that is proffered by you in any receipt, invoice, acceptance, purchase order, confirmation, correspondence, or otherwise, regardless of Contentio’s failure to object to such terms, provisions or conditions.
                                    <br/> <br/>
                        Relationship; Independent Contractor. Nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to constitute the parties as principal and agent, employer and employee, partners or joint venturers, nor shall any similar relationship be deemed to exist between the parties. Neither party shall have any power to obligate or bind the other party, except as specifically provided herein.

                        DMCA. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that content or material on the Products, the Website, the Sites, or on Contentio’s website (www.sproutsocial.com) or any of its web properties hosted on the sproutsocial.com domain infringes a copyright owned by you, you (or your agent) may send Contentio DMCA agent a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. This request should be sent to: info@contentio.pro. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the website should be sent to the address above.

The information we receive when you authenticate through a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in the relevant third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.
                                    <br/> <br/>
